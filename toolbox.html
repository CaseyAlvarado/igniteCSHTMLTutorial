      <h3> Tables </h3>
      <p> What if we want to make a table of all of our friends' phone numbers? </p>
        Here is how you make a table: 
        <!-- This table wil be 50% of the normal size. You can also change the size of to be in pixels like so: style = "width: 50px". You can also set the height of the table in this way. Why don't you try playing around with this?--> 
        <table style = "width: 50%"> 
          <tr> 
            This is a table row inside the table. 
            <td> This is a table data cell inside the table. Columns do not exist in HTML. Instead, you have to make a row (tr) with as many data cells (td)s as you would like columns. </td>
            <td> This is another table data cell. See how this table data cell appears like a second column? <td>
          </tr>
          <tr> 
            <td> <b> My Friend</b> </td>
            <td> <b> Their Phone Number</b></td>
          </tr>
          <tr> 
            <td> Brenna </td>
            <td> (617)-957-8555 </td>
          </tr>
          <tr> 
            <td> My Mom</td>
            <td> (713)-816-9983 </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
    </div>

      <h3> Buttons and Alerts</h3>
      <p> What if we want to make a button that produces an alert on your screen whenever you press it? Here's how! We can make the alert using javascript, a more complex programming language for web development. </p>
      <button type = "button" onClick = "alert ('Hey, you clicked me!')"> Press me!</button>
    </div>
    
  </body>
